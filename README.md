For my first Python project, I created a QR code generator website. The website allows users to input any URL, which is then converted into a QR code that can be downloaded or shared. The project utilizes Python libraries such as Flask, qrcode, etc for generating QR codes, and it offers a simple and intuitive interface for easy use. This project helped me understand web development concepts and the practical application of Python in creating useful tools.
